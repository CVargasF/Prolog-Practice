# Prolog-Practice
This practice was done by Camilo Vargas Friedli. 
The objective of this practice is to make a basis query system for a car dealership in prolog. 
In the files you will find 1 file named "Dealership", 1 folder named "Screenshots" and a video. 
"Dealership" includes the original prolog file, "Screenshots" show the test cases and the video gives an explanation.
